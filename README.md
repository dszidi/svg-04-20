# SVG for Assets and Apps

## Slides
Slides were saved as pdf and the rest is inside the src directory.

## Inline SVG Demo
To play with inline SVG inside a browser, simply open index.html in a browser (I used Chromium for the talk).

## Inkscape Symbol Set
To install the example symbol set into inkscape just put the os-icons.svg into $HOME/.config/inkscape/symbols and restart Inkscape. (You might have to create this directory if it doesn't already exist)
